*********************************Computer Basics***********************************************************************************************

Program: It is a set of instructions or code that is written to perform a specific task on computer.

Software: Software refers to a collection of programs, libraries, and other resources that are designed to work together
to perform specific task on computer.

Platform: 

1.Hardware Platform: The hardware platform refers to the physical infrastructure on which the software runs.
It includes the computer's architecture, processor, memory, storage devices, and other components.

2.Operating System Platform: The operating system platform is the software layer that manages hardware resources
and provides a set of services and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for applications to run on top of it.
Ex: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

3.Software Development Platform: The software development platform encompasses the tools, libraries, 
and frameworks used by developers to create applications or services.
It includes programming languages, software development kits (SDKs), and other development tools.

4.Application Platforms: These platforms provide an environment for developers to create and run specific types of applications,
such as web applications, mobile applications, or desktop applications.
Ex:
web application frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Django,
mobile app development platforms like iOS or Android SDKs,
Desktop application frameworks like Electron

5.Cloud Platforms: Cloud platforms offer services and infrastructure to deploy and manage applications in the cloud.
They provide a range of services like virtual machines, storage, databases, and analytics tools. 
Ex: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

HARDWARE COMPONENTS OF COMPUTER

CPU: Brain of computer. It performs most of the calculations and executes instructions of a computer program.

RAM: volatile memory that stores data that the CPU needs to access quickly. 
The amount of RAM affects the computer's performance, as more RAM allows for smoother multitasking and faster data access.

Graphics card: is responsible for rendering images, videos, and animations.

object-oriented: Everything in java follows object-oriented paradigm.

Portable: Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. 
We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machin

Platform Independent:Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.

Secured: Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers.

High-level languages: It use of a compiler or an interpreter for their translation into the machine code.

Low-level language: It use an assembler for directly translating the instructions of the machine language.

Interpreted: Java uses the Just-in-time (JIT) interpreter.

Architecture Neutral: Java is architectural neutral as it is not dependent on the architecture. 
In C, the size of data types may vary according to the architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.

High Performance: Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages 
because Java bytecode is "close" to native code.

Multithreaded: We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.
The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread.It shares a common memory area.
Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.

JDK: JRE + development tools + APIs for devloping java applications.
JRE: JVM + set of libraries.
JVM: It provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.

JRE-implements the runtime environment whereas JVM provides runtime environment. JVM physically exits.

what is Java?
Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent,
high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991.
It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE.
